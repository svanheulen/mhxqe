Current limitations:
    * Only works with decrypted DLC quests.
    * You can only modify what's already in the quest.
    * Many of the settings don't have very good descriptions.
    * Small monster info is left in hex because the format is unknown.
    * You have to use other software to proxy quests to the game.

To use the quest editor visit: http://svanheulen.github.io/mhxqe
